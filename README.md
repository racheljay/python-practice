# Python Practice

## Madlibs: 
- declare variables
- input information
- print result
- using f strings

## Guess the Number:
- use randint from the random module
- while loops
- using if and elif

## Rock Paper Scissors
- Use random.choice to select a random item from an array
- More conditional rendering

## Hangman
- Use the string library
- Use .upper (similar to toUpperCase)
- Use len (similar to .length)
- Use sets
    - sets store multiple items in a single variable
    - unordered and un-indexed
 
 ## Tic-Tac-Toe
 - Classes
 - the __init__() function
    - works like a constructor in js
    - self parameter: references the current instance of the class and is used to access variables belonging to the class (kind of like this in js)
        - this doesn't have to be called self, but it will always be the first parameter
- static method
- tuples
- loops
- Enumerate
    - makes a list of tuples. The tuples contain the index and the value for each entry on the original data structure
- Raise
    - A way to set up error feedback if there is an issue or if a condition is not met
- ValueError
    - Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as IndexError
